# About

Hey there, I am Quentin, a final year PhD student in the [Gilestro lab](https://lab.gilest.ro/) (at Imperial College London). I have always been fascinated by the diversity of life forms, and how different organisms have adapted to a wide range of constraints. Over the years, I also developed a passion for open-source software which naturally led me to study computational biology, statistics and machine learning.

I am currently part of a multidisciplinary team where I work right at the intersection between my two interests.
My collaborators and I try to understand the *physiology of sleep*, using *Drosophila* as a model.
So far, my main contributions have been in:

* Building the [Ethoscope Platform](https://gilestrolab.github.io/ethoscope/), a real-time tracking system that monitors hundreds of animals at a time
* Developing [Rethomics](http://rethomics.github.io/), a pipeline to analyse high-throughput behaviour data
* Using these approaches to challenge our understanding of sleep (*e.g.* physiology of sleep deprivation, trade-offs between sleeping and mating)
