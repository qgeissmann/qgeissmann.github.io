Sleep is a fascinating mystery that has bemused thinkers since the dawn of civilisations. Scientifically, the formalisation of sleep as an observable behaviour has been a conceptual milestone, which has enabled researchers to address the question of its ubiquity and ultimately led to the discovery of sleep-like states in most animal phyla. The fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster* has long been at the vanguard of the discovery of many biological processes. During my PhD, I worked on the quantification and alteration and of sleep in *Drosophila*. You can read more about my work in my thesis: [High-throughput Recording, Analysis andManipulation of Sleep in Drosophila](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/69514/3/Geissmann-Q-2018-PhD-Thesis.pdf).
