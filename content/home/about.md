# About

Hey there, I am Quentin, a postdoc in the [Haney](https://haneylab.msl.ubc.ca/) 
and [Carrillo](https://lfs-carrillo.sites.olt.ubc.ca/)
labs at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/).
I have always been fascinated by the diversity of life forms, and how different organisms have adapted to a wide range of constraints.
Over the years, I also developed a passion for open-source software which naturally led me to study computational biology, statistics and machine learning.

My primary interest is to bridge the gap between area data sciences/engineering and physiology/behaviour/ecology. 
I particularly devote this attention to insects -- towards a *computational entomology*. 
One application on this approach I am currently actively pursuing, is the study of insect [chronobiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronobiology) 
directly in their natural environment developing smart insect traps.
